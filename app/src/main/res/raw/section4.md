# Housing

The university provides its own array of housing options alongside an increasingly competitive student housing market in the Waterloo area.

Most places will require that you sign a 1 year lease, during which you will have to acquire a 4 month sublet if you are not in Waterloo one term. If you are away for 2 terms (perhaps for coop), just subletting a room would be more sensible.
